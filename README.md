# modernmybb

MyBB core modification: 
Replace outdated Usenet Threaded Mode with discussion threaded like on modern social media 

Usenet threaded mode is so obsolete that many board admins disable it at all.
The linear mode that is called "modern" in the BBs world is so ugly and cumbersome that
practically no new internet applications use it anymore.

This collaborative project aims to upgrade the MyBB GUI to modern social media standards.
